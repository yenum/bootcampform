Bootcamp Registration Form

Version : 2.0

About the Project:

This is a simple registration form built using React js. It collects basic, simple information about the user and the project focuses on the front end of the form. 

Features of the project:

The user is able to enter their first and last name as well as an email. There is also some client validation built into the form to ensure the user enters the correct data at the time of submission. If the user enters the details on the form correctly, they should see a success page notifying them that the form has been submitted successfully.

Technical Knowledege Used:

For this project, I used React Hooks to manage state and also made use of custom hooks in parts of the project. Custom Hooks was used to make the code a lot cleaner and manageable over time. In addition, I used basic CSS to apply the styles on the form page. Final project was deployed on Netlify.
