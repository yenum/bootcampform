Bootcamp Registration Form

About the Project:

This is a simple registration form built using React js. It collects basic, simple information about the user and the project focuses on the front end of the form. 

Features of the project:

The user is able to enter their first and last name as well as an email. There is also some client validation built into the form to ensure the user enters the correct data at the time of submission. 

Technical Knowledege Used:

For this project, I used HTML to provide client side validation.  In addition, I used basic CSS to apply the styles on the form page. Final project was deployed on Netlify.
